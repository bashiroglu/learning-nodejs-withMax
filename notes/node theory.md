### Node JS

In some back-end programming langs, you need server and then that server run your code to listen requests etc. But in Node Js, node handle all, being specific run server, get reqs and send reses.

In Node we have event loop which help us to listen requests. When we execute our file, we creaete our server then listen to reqs, and if we have registered listen function, app keep runing to wait for reqs.

In Node files we have automatically access to require and module objects to import and export. This all comes with wrapper function, that function take our file and give use the file with some additional functionalities.
