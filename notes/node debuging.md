## Node debuging

In our node code we can use vs code debuger to debug our code for that we can go debug section and start debuging with node environment, then we can put our breaking points which help us to see values of variables. By that we can detect the place where our code do something wrong.

Additional features of debug in vs code:
- we can run some code in debug console
- we can also modifie variables while debuging
